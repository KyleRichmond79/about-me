    <p>Salutations! My name is Kyle Richmond and I am originally from Fort Wayne, IN.
    I have lived in Seattle for a little over 4 years now. I am a hobbiest gamer. I enjoy table top RPGs
    (role playing games using paper, pencil, and dice.), LARPs (Live action role playing) where you dress up
    in costumes, use foam weapons, Nerf guns, and interact with other players while working together creating a story.</p>

    <p>I have very little coding experience in my past other than some very basic HTML from Angelfire and Geocities
    chat rooms. I am excited to be learning coding and looking forward to seeing where my coding path takes me.</p>

    <p>One of my goals is to be able to create a website, for one of the LARPs I created, that will allow a player to Created and manage that character, have an in game store, bank, and functioning "hacking game".</p>
