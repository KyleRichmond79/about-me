    <p>I have a couple of hobbies that I partake in on my free time, the first is called boffer LARP (Live Action Role Playing). In a boffer LARP you as a player create a character, figure out your costume, get LARP save weapons and gear gear; then go to
      an event as your character and engage with other players to tell a story, which can sometimes include battle with latex swords and nerf guns. It is very similar to impromptu or improvisational theater because you are literally just making up dialogue
      based on a given scenario given to you by the game storyteller. My main boffer LARP that I play in currently is a Star Wars LARP. I am in the process of writing my own boffer LARP using a Cyberpunk theme. It is a work in progress and I am hoping
      to create a website for it.</p>

    <p>My second hobby is similar to my first but it is called theater LARP. The main difference is theatrical LARP does not engage in physical combat resolution. Conflicts are resolved using rock, paper, scissors. That may sound silly but it is actually
      a very effective method. You still create a character, figure out a costume, and gather props to make the setting feel more realistic. There are a couple of settings but Vampire: The Masquerade and Werewolf: The Apocolypse are the two main settings
      I play in.</p>

    <p>My third hobby I like to do is play video games. I currently have four consoles that I play on, an original XBox, XBox 360, XBoxOne, and Nintendo Wii. Some of my favorite games are Halo series, Fallout 4, Watch Dogs 1 & 2, Knights of the Old Republic
      1 & 2, and Mass Effect series. But if you were to sit me down in front of just about any first person shooter or RPG game, I would play it.</p>
